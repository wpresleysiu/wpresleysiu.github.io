			<p1>Grill - </p1>
			<p2>There are a bizmillion different types of grills out there, with even more different features.  There's charcoal grills, propane grills, offset smokers, pellet smokers, and even literal pits dug into the ground.  If you're just getting started, a basic Weber kettle grill will work fine.  Just make sure it's big enough to fit everything you need to cook on half of the grill space.  You'll need the space to create separate temperature zones.</p2>

		<div id="getstartcontent4" class="gstext">
			<p1>Fuel - </p1>
			<p2>You need fire, and fire needs fuel.  Charcoal has become the most popular grilling fuel, since it burns for a long time at a relatively consistent temperature.  You can use lump charcoal or briquettes and get very similar results.  Just avoid the "instant" charcoal.  They are basically just doused in lighter fluid and you can taste it in your food.</p2>
		</div>
		<div id="getstartcontent5" class="gstext">
			<p1>Tools - </p1>
			<p2>Please do not touch the fire.  Get some tongs.  You may need to move some of your charcoal around to keep an even temperature, and some recipes will require you to move your food around the grill while it's cooking.  In either case, tongs work much better than your fingers.</p2><br>
			<p3>It is very important to keep your grill clean if you want it to last, so you'll need a wire grill brush.</p3><br>
			<p4>A reliable temperature probe is a great tool to help you get perfectly cooked meat, but more importantly, it let's you know when your food is safe to eat.  Undercooked food, especially poultry, can be very dangerous, so a temperature probe is required.</p4>

			<p1>More Tools - </p1>
			<p2>If you have everything listed above, you're ready to start barbequing.  But it's nice to have some extras too.</p2><br>

			<p1>Grill Care- </p1>
			<p2>Nobody wants to eat food from a rusty grill, so if you want your grill to last, you'll need to take care of it.  The first thing you should do when you get a new grill, before you even assemble it, is wash it thoroughly with water and dish soap.  Then let it dry and put it all together.  At this point, you might be tempted to start cooking, but there's one more step you should take.  In order to prevent rust, you'll want to season your grill.  Get a wad of paper towels doused in a high temp oil such as canola oil, and apply the oil to all of the surfaces inside, including the grates.  Line the bottom of your grill with foil, and add enough charcoal to get your grill as hot as you can.  Then, just close the lid and let the charcoal burn out.  This will create a protective coating and help keep rust away.  Depending on how often you use your grill, you should season it once every few months to at least once per year.</p2><br>
			<p3>Maintaining a clean grill is fairly simple.  If you have a nylon brush, you can use it to get most of the residue off the grates while the grill is still cold.  Then, heat up your grill and use a wire brush the get the rest of it.  Finally, right before you put your food on, douse a wad of paper towels in cooking oil and wipe the grates.  Every once in a while, you should clean your grates with water and dish soap as well.</p3>

		<div id="getstartcontent9" class="gstext">
			<p1>Fire Setup - </p1>
			<p2>As mentioned earlier, charcoal is usually your best heat source for grilling.  There are ways to cheat.  Propane grills exist for some reason, but you probably have a stove in your house already, so there's really no reason to have a propane grill.  Pellet grills are another option, and they yield similar results to a wood smoker.  If you are only interested in the end result, and not interested in the craftsmanship that goes into barbeque, then a pellet grill is a good way to get a decent barbequed meal without the effort.  Just know that a $1000 pellet grill can't replace knowledge and experience.</p2><br>
			<p3>If you're using charcoal, you should get a chimney starter.  Fill the bottom with paper, such as the pieces of the paper bag the charcoal came in, and fill the top with charcoal.  Then just light the paper and wait for your charcoal to start to turn white around the edges.  You do NOT need lighter fluid.</p3><br>
			<p4>The placement of your charcoal will depend on what you're cooking and what kind of equipment you're using.  One way to do it is to put all of the charcoal on one side of the grill, creating two different temperature zones.  The half of the grill directly over the charcoal is called direct heat, which is good for charring your food, giving it a delicious, blackened crust.  The other half of the grill is indirect heat, which works more like an oven, cooking your food all the way through.  Many recipes taste great when a combination of direct and indirect heat is used.</p4>
